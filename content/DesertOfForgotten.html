			<p>A vast expanse of sand dunes whose borders cannot be traced as they simply do not exist. Beneath these dunes lie countless artifacts—forgotten relics that once held profound emotional connections to their owners. Currently known as The Desert of Forgotten, this place stands as one of the few locations renowned for preserving remnants of the past.</p>
			<p>There is a solitary, metalled one-way road where a lone bus operates, often seen empty. When questioned about the whereabouts of the bus station, the driver remains silent, he can be vocally impaired? The bus itself is in a state of considerable disrepair. The floor has been corroded by rust, and the seats have lost their leather covering, exposing yellow-stained thermocol and synthetic material beneath. Under the scorching sun, the interior becomes oven-like, with the tin roof becoming so hot that touching it can result in minor burns. Now, let's discuss the destination the bus will take you to. Interestingly, there is no ticket collector on board, and the driver does not seem to care about it. If you find yourself at an empty station, rest assured that the bus will arrive to pick you up within a maximum of two hours, often even sooner, typically within an hour.</p>
			<p>The road will continue for approximately 300 kilometers before coming to an end, with the bus maintaining a steady speed. It's important to note that the sun never sets in this peculiar setting, relentlessly scorching the land. Therefore, it is highly advisable to carry a reflective sheet to shield yourself from the intense heat, as well as ample supplies of hydrating substances to stay properly hydrated throughout the journey.</p>
			<p>After around 5 hours, the bus will finally come to a stop. As you reach the road-end, about 300 meters away, you will notice a mini-amphitheater. Silhouettes of people can be seen there, walking, dancing, and seemingly enjoying one another's company. However, as you draw closer, they mysteriously begin to vanish. It is advised to avoid entering the mini-amphitheater unless absolutely necessary. Curiously, the interior of the mini-amphitheater is engulfed in complete darkness. Even the sun's rays cannot penetrate the depths, leaving only the pillars along the border visible. Occasional movements can be spotted within, but they could very well be nocturnal creatures that may not be friendly towards you. </p>
			<p>In addition to the mini-amphitheater, scattered throughout the surrounding area, you'll find remnants of ruins—fallen pillars and partially submerged walls. While exploring, you may come across various items strewn about, but it is important not to take anything that does not rightfully belong to you. Exercise caution and respect the belongings left behind in this enigmatic place.</p>
			<p>This place works in mysterious ways. By continuing to explore, you may stumble upon something from your own past, a long-forgotten belonging that lies in front of you, waiting to flood your memories. It could be an old toy, a piece of cloth, jewelry, or some old photos—anything from your past. You may consider taking it back with you, but don't try that. There are relic guardians that live in the desert, and they will only come after you when you try to take something with you. I wonder if the silhouettes near the structure were actually the relic guardians. Regardless, it will be a pain to deal with so many of them under these peril conditions.</p>
			<p>Aside from that, there is not much in the desert. As for your exit, there are several dry wells that can be found in the surrounding area, and most of them have an exit. It's more like an entry to another plane. The depth usually ranges from 10 to 15 meters at most, and the diameter ranges from 2 to 4 meters. The floor is often soft due to the sand, but there are also protruding rocks that serve as steps. Thus, jumping straight in is not the only option for you. After descending, you can find a big enough hole to pass through at the bottom. These tunnels lead to various places randomly, connecting to different timelines in different corporeal realms. Any tunnel to an ascendant realm is yet to be discovered. Farther the wells from amphitheater, the more likely they will have a blocked tunnel.</p>
			<p>It's been around 78 hours since I arrived at this place, my water supplies are reaching their limits. I have already briefly checked atleast few dozens of these wells now, and it's time for me to head into one. The sun really doesn't budge from it's position here, locked in the sky for forever. I can hear chantings from the other side of this tunnel in front of me, sounds barely human, must be getting distorted. Maybe it's the best choice to go through this one.</p>
