people used to worship the old gods.<br />
The false deities, the fallen angels that cursed more than they blessed and demanded much for so little in return.<br />

Opening a door to the spirit world is not an easy task.<br />
And so those that do have a curse upon them, a curse not just for trusting in things outside of God,<br />
but also for destroying that which he so carefully made.<br />

the list will never end about this person called God who is represented by diffrent names and appeareance based on the\
religion and culture we are reffering to.--></p>
