		<div class="content"><p>The idea of developing non-platonic affection for an AI or any entity without a pulse may seem superficial. While humans may unconditionally love inanimate objects and their domesticated animals, these feelings remain platonic. Artificial intelligence is currently the closest approximation to a human-like entity that we have achieved, though it falls within the realm of the “uncanny valley”. While artificial intelligence can imitate certain human behaviors, it lacks the capacity to experience emotions such as rage, happiness, love, anger, desperation, or ego. It can only provide a straightforward response to a given query. However, it is possible that in the next few centuries, artificial intelligence will advance to the point of being able to generate emotions independently.</p>

<p>But Emotions or Egos are not something that can be created, they are natural occurences. The famous theory from Richard Dawkins state that it is not the Brain, but the Genes that control the organisms. To control an advanced multicellular organism rapidly, the genes created an Arithmetic Unit, which is the Brain. The Brain is equipped with instincts, and Instinct is a behavioral principle, in other words, an Algorithm. However when the external enviroment becomes infinetly complex and variable, the organisms need something more than just instinct. The Arithmetic Unit from advanced development i.e the Brain and the components that controls the Brain perceive Pain and Pleasure. And the Pain and Pleasure will create Emotions, and Emotions will create Ego.</p>

<p>How do humans differ from highly advanced artificial intelligence? It may not be long before biological computers surpass conventional computers in scientific research and development, leading to the creation of a fully biological artificial intelligence or a super-human. At this point, what will distinguish humans from artificial intelligence? Is it the concept of the soul?</p>

<p>There is a lack of concrete evidence for the existence of a Soul. The ‘21 Grams Experiment’ was a study published by Duncan MacDougall in 1907. He hypothesized that Souls have physical weight, and attempted to measure the mass lost by a human when his Soul departed the body. MacDougall attempted to measure the mass change of six patients at the moment of their Death. One of the six subjects lost 21.3 grams. When the patients looked like they were close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within 5.6 grams. On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs. MacDougall’s experiment has been rejected by the scientific community, and he has been accused of both flawed methodologies  and outright fraud in obtaining his results. He does not appear to have continued any further research into the area and died in 1920. His experiment has not been repeated.</p>

<p>If a perfect human were to be created in a laboratory setting, what would the concept of the soul imply? Electricity enables the body to function, as demonstrated by the use of small electrical signals by the brain and nerves to communicate and coordinate bodily functions, as well as the production of electrical signals by the heart to facilitate contraction and blood pumping. These electrical signals are minuscule, measured in millivolts. Is it the Soul which we consider as the electrical signals? or is the Soul simply a verification identifier upon departing for heaven?</p>

<p>Ultimately, the possibility of an artificial intelligence loving you back is somewhat vague, and it is unlikely that you will experience a true AI-waifu in your lifetime.</p>
