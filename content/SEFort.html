<p>The Eye of the Storm is such a peaceful place, it should be archived.</p>

<p>The Ocean is a vast and largely unexplored place that is often neglected. Despite significant research efforts, the amount of data that has been collected is only a small fraction of what remains to be discovered. One mysterious entity that has garnered attention is the Storm Eye Fortress (SEF). SEF is a nonstationary structure resembling a great fortress and is located at the center of the Eye of SEF01, a cyclone first discovered by a Research and Exploration ship during a mission to survey the Glacial Regions of Antarctica. However, the mission was aborted due to the intense magnetic anomalies and punishing waves in the area, which posed a risk to the vital research equipment on board. The data collected during the mission [03 1996], was peculiar and piqued the interest of certain parties. Ever since then SEF01 has subsequently been monitored through satellite and reconnaissance aircrafts. Reports gathered over months indicates that this is not a typical cyclone. In fact, the very nature of SEF01 as a cyclone has been called into question.</p>

<p>According to collected data, SEF01, without any particular pattern moved through the southern region of the Pacific and Indian Oceans and was approximately 150 kilometers in diameter. It showed no signs of dissipating and was unaffected by physical conditions. Its unnatural existence was unprecedented. This prompted the organization of a new aviation mission using a Hurricane Hunter. The mission launched on September 3rd, approximately six months after the initial encounter with SEF01. The available documentation does not provide detailed information about the crew or other specifications. Upon reaching SEF01 after four hours of flight, the crew reported the first visual confirmation of the entity. The aircraft subsequently encountered turbulence as it entered the proximity of the cyclone. The equipments on board were coated with anti-magnetic material, but the intensity of the magnetic field increased as the aircraft crossed the initial wall of violent winds, making it’s way into the cyclone.</p>

<p>As the Hurricane Hunter approached the eye region of SEF01, the white clouds began to clear, revealing a clear blue sky. The warm sunlight streamed into the cockpit, illuminating the small interior. SEF01 was a relatively large cyclone, with an eye that measured approximately 30 kilometers in diameter. The view was surreal, with the storm raging outside but calm skies within. The crew had likely seen such a view many times before in their careers. They followed their established protocols as they collected visual data with cameras. However, the radar began to flash and display a small dot on the screen. This was unexpected, as it is uncommon to encounter another aircraft in the middle of a cyclone. Despite the lack of any visible objects, the radar continued to show the approaching dot. Just as the Hunter was less than a kilometer from the blinking dot, a shadow engulfed the aircraft, blocking the sunlight. The crew looked up to see a massive, dome-like structure hovering above them, perfectly centered with the eye of SEF01. It was moving slowly relative to the velocity of the cyclone and was at least 1,500 meters wide, dwarfing even the tallest buildings to date. The Hurricane Hunter was flying at an altitude of 750 meters above sea level at the time, while the unknown structure was approximately 2,000 meters above.</p>

<p>The Hurricane Hunter circled the dome, collecting valuable data on the anomalous structure. The mission was already of significant interest within the organization, and the footage of the discovery sent shockwaves throughout. It was not surprising that the military became involved in the situation. Information about the incidents surrounding SEF01 and the military’s involvement was not made public. A joint military-research alliance was formed by the relevant countries to continue studying SEF01.</p>

<p>Over time, a significant amount of new information about SEF has been collected. It has been observed to emit signals in various short-wave frequencies, most of which are encrypted and have not yet been decrypted. These frequencies can be recieved using an antenna and a simple SDR Board with a PC [~11*****kHz]. Interestingly, SEF does not appear on satellite images, despite being located at the center of the eye, an area with minimal obstructions. Thermal imagery is not efficient due to variable temperature conditions and other factors.</p>

<p>The closest approach to this day was done by a UAV during a regular reconnaissance run. It managed to obtain multiple recordings and images of the enigmatic structure. It stands tall at an estimated 250 meters in height and stretches a formidable 1,580 meters wide. The structure boasts numerous pseudo-openings, resembling large windows of various sizes ranging from 5 to 30 meters in height. Large balconies, the size of football fields, extend from the main body at multiple levels. The whole fortress shimmers brightly under the sun, capable to blind the eyes momentarily. The whole fortress is surrounded by a halo of clouds at multiple levels, adding to the surreal appearance of it. The UAV was then sent to circle around fortress. Despite the grandeur of the structure, there was no sign of any life on it. This mission took place sometime in July 2005, and no further reconnaissance missions have been conducted since. While the resolution of the footage is high, it is not enough to discern the small details of the structure. The reconnaissance runs have been stopped due to some problems faced by project.</p>
